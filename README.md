# Dating-App-CSCI-2270- (in C++11)
This project was created with the intent to help computer science majors find suitable dates. This was our final project for Computer scinence class at colorado boulder. Please dive into the structural layout of the app and take note we only were given two weeks to create the whole project. It was a fun one in which we made it personal using alot of associates to integrate as trial subjects. This app uses one graph, a priority queue, and vectors in which we use to find who would be the best match for one person in terms of dating.
